1. The data suggests that Capomulin and Ramicane had the smallest mean and
median concerning tumor volume. The mean and median in this case were derived
from the total tumor volume over time. This suggests that both Capomulin and 
Ramican showed the most promise in tumor shrinkage. These two regimens also
showed the least amount of variance, stard error from the mean, and the
smallest standard deviation showing that the efficacy of this drug across 
multiple test subjects is pretty favorable.

2. The gender distribution between test subjects was very close to equal
which approximates the distribution of the general population. This is 
favorable in data collection. The data also suggests a weakly moderate
correlation (r=0.53) between specimen weight and tumor volume.

3. When looking at the interquartile range, the lower, the middle, and the
upper quartiles, Capomulin and Ramicane show not only a much tighter
distribution but also show not outliers within the data. Ramicane's upper 
quartile (45.22 mm3), lower quartile (22.05 mm3), and median (36.56 mm3) are
lower than Capomulin's upper, lower, and median (47.69 mm3, 23.34 mm3, and
38.13 mm3). This suggests that Ramicane may be a slightly more promising 
regimen in Tumor recession.
